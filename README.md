## ðŸŒ± Introduction

Agriculture is one of the most vital sectors in the world, yet it contributes significantly to environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, excessive water use, and soil degradation. This project aims to develop a smart, eco-friendly AI tool that can guide farmers toward sustainable agricultural decisions, optimizing yield while minimizing environmental impact.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to assist with crop prediction, fertilizer recommendation, or pest detection.
- Promote sustainable farming practices.
- Reduce overuse of harmful chemicals and resources.
- Provide actionable insights based on environmental and agricultural data.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Smart crop recommendation system based on soil and climate data.
- Fertilizer usage advisory to prevent over-fertilization.
- Pest prediction and early warning system.
- AI-driven decision support to reduce environmental footprint.
- User-friendly interface for farmers and stakeholders (planned).

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

Possible datasets used:
- Soil type and nutrient composition data.
- Climate and rainfall data.
- Historical crop yield statistics.
- Pest incidence reports.

Sources include:
- Kaggle
- Government open data (India Agri Dept, FAO)
- Local farm records (if applicable)

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (depending on the model)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Streamlit/Flask for interactive tool

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Training
